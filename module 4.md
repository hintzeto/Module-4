# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Talon Hintze

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?

    4

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |      X        |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    * Create a database with at least one table
    * Perform CRUD operations
    * Write software that builds the SQL commands, submits them, receives the results from the database, and uses the results in some way.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

    * Youtube
    * W3Schools
    * ChatGPT
    * Tutorials Point

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

    I will first learn how to create a table in SQLite and perform basic CRUD applications on it. After which I plan on creating a second table and working with joins. My last step is going to be using the information in the database in some sort of GUI.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

    I plan on submitting a software that holds user information in one table and their rank in a game in another. The software will be able to display different users and show information about their in game rank/level.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

    I will work on this IM for at least 1 hour MWF immediately after class and at least 2 hours at other periods during the week. My MWF work will be in a study room at the STC.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

    I don't anticipate many technical difficulties. I do forsee that finding times outside of MWF to work on this project will be difficult. I struggle to hit the 10 hours each sprint. In order to cope with this I will keep a closer eye on my time log and evaluate my progress daily.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 6/10/24  |  11:20   |  IM    | Creating test tables and starting inserts  |    1:14     |
| 6/11/24  |  8:21    |  IM    | Creating a GUI for user entry              |    1:24     |
| 6/15/24  |  10:21   |  IM    | Learning more SQL                          |    0:57     |
| 6/18/24  |  6:14    |  IM    | Adding functionality                       |    1:34     |
| 6/18/24  |  9:07    |  TP    | Reinitializing Django                      |    2:02     |
| 6/20/24  |  8:30    |  IM    | Researching and learning larger datasets   |    4:00     |
| 6/21/24  |  1:28    |  IM    | Documentation write ups                    |         |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

    https://github.com/hintzeto/Module-4.git

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

    

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |        |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   Yes  |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   Yes  |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   Yes  |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   Yes  |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

    I used multiple tables with a join and made a trigger that automatically fills out certain fields under certain conditions.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

    No.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|      9:09         |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

    Something that worked well was stacking. I realized that I do a lot of learning outside of particular study for this class that helps with this course's content. Realizing this connection helped me to learn and apply knowledge faster. Something I can improve on for next sprint is doing more tutorials. I really struggle with hittting my time requirements even though I meet the other requirements.
