## Overview

**Project Title**: User Management System

**Project Description**: A basic program to manage users in a sqlite3 database.

**Project Goals**: Learn how to create tables in sqlite and interact with them in a gui.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Intialize tables in sqlite3
2. Fill in tables with starting data
3. Create a trigger to automatically assign values for new users
4. Create a GUI to interact with the database (CRUD)

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the tutor.py file first to initialize the database.
2. Run the main.py file and play around with the GUI
3. You may need to install certain packages like ttkthemes. VSCode will let you know what packages are missing.
